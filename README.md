Burd's Brown Egg is a React web application for the game Burd's Brown Egg. The game is part myth, part joke, but an actual thing. The website allows user to learn about the game, it's history, the rules, etc.

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>

Tech used: JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS

The main idea for this project was to create a simple React Website. I wanted to get back to some React basics and solidify components, layouts, react-router-dom, and other React fundamentals. Burd's Brown Egg was an easy way to fill in content for the website. Other tools used include:

react-router-dom, sweetalert2, emailjs-com

<h1>Optimizations:</h1>

This app was designed to be simple. If I were to expand it, I would include:

- allowing the user to add their games to the inventory, including the location, number of players, result, and a description.
- create a mini game player on the website that allows the user to toss the egg from room to room. This would serve as a way to better understand the game while having fun.
- make the eggs on the home screen more dynamic or change up their styling. I am not a huge fan of how they currently look.

<h1>Lessons Learned:</h1>

Creating a React website and using react-router-dom is fairly simple. Using state, props, and hooks still doesn't feel as intuitve as I would like it. I am going to focus future efforts on mastering these skills, which really allow React websites to come to life. I am getting better at moving on from ideas/concepts that are taking up a lot of time when there are other good solutions. Being stubborn and frustrated does not result in efficient or quick solutions to development issues (at least in my experience). I am going to continue workig on Tea Time and focusing on connecting the client side and server side of React sites.
